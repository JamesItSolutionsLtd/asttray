asttray
=======
AstTray is a very simple windows tray tool for displaying incoming call information and allowing click2call (call originate).
AstTray requires each user have their own manager login. Configuration is handled by the App.config file and is pretty simple!

## The Future
This is a list of the features I am adding at the moment: -
* Screen Popping
* Local Directory
* Call History
 * Made, Received and Missed
* Shared or Company Directory
** XML file store, but also supports Cisco Directory XML from web resource

## Dependencies
https://github.com/skrusty/AsterNET AsterNet - Based on Asterisk.NET

For more information, see http://www.xdev.net or follow me @benjmerrills

*Please Note* ~~Currently, AstTray only works on Asterisk 1.8 or above.~~
Thanks to AdamantUK, support has now been added for AMI 1.0, Asterisk 1.4.
