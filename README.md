asttray
=======
AstTray is a very simple windows tray tool for displaying incoming call information and allowing click2call (call originate).
AstTray requires each user have their own manager login. Configuration is handled by the App.config file and is pretty simple!

## Supports
* Click to dial (Call Originate)
* Call Logging (Inbound/Outbound)
* Cisco XML Directory
* Screen Popping (Url in default browser only atm)

## The Future
This is a list of the features I am adding at the moment: -
* Missed Call Logging
* Queue Support
* Agent Support
* Conference (confbridge) support
* Custom actions (click for voicemail etc)
* Extension listing/presense?

## Dependencies
